## Brief Overview
EByte is a ransomware written from scratch in Go. It uses a mixture of ChaCha20 and ECIES cryptography to encrypt files securely so that they cannot be recovered by traditional recovery tools. Files encrypted by EByte can only be decrypted using the corresponding decryptor.

## Installation & Setup
### Pre-requisites:
- [The Go Programming Language](https://go.dev)

## Running:
- ```go run server.go```

## Encryption Process
- The encryptor enumerates all drives on the system and proceeds to iterate through each directory recursively.
- It ignores blacklisted files, directories, and extensions.
- It generates a unique ChaCha20 key and nonce for each file and encrypts the file using a pattern of 1 byte encrypted, 2 bytes unencrypted.
- It encrypts the ChaCha20 key and nonce using the ECIES public key and prepends them to the start of the file.

## Benefits of ChaCha20 and ECIES
I chose this unique combination of encryption methods for several reasons:
- ChaCha20's stream-based approach allows for byte-by-byte encryption, enabling the pattern of 1 byte encrypted, 2 bytes unencrypted.
- ECIES offers similar security to RSA with shorter key lengths, making it a more efficient choice.
